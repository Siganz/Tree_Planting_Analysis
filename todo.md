# TO DO 
## 7/6/2025
- [ ] I removed some items in user.example.yaml, so I need to make sure those removed variables aren't used elsewhere. 
- [ ] I need to find a way to utilize .env corerctly. Perhaps the best thing is to run a script on open, to check if .env is there, else create folder, create yaml with default inputs. 
- [ ] Scafffold a main.py within stp. Needs to fetch configs, auto download, gpkg, then output shapefiles and csv. 
- [ ] List out the steps of the project within the stp readme.
